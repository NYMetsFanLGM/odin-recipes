    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>this is a roast ham I made previously for Chistmas for my relatives.  I
        was able to find the recipe from this website <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/baked-ham-with-brown-sugar-glaze/">ham</a>
    </p>
    <p>There are a couple of ingredient differences between what I used and what 
        the website suggests.  While I used orange juice, which is suggeted if 
        preferred over pineapple juice, I used ground cinnamon instead of ground
        ginger and used honey mustard instead of dijon mustard.
    </p>
